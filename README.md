Slide is an open source, ad free Reddit browser for iOS. It is based around
the [Reddift](https://github.com/sonsongithub/reddift).

Slide is not yet avaliable for download on the App Store, but there is a small TestFlight group. For more information regarding availability, feel free to join us on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slide_ios)  



## Contributing

### Getting started
To get started with Slide iOS development, you need to set up Cocoapods integration and open the Coacoapods workspace, not the default xcworkspace. Below are the steps to getting started:

    1. Terminal: sudo gem install cocoapods
    2. Safari: Downloaded Slide from GitHub (clone or download -> Download Zip)
    3. Terminal: cd Downloads/Slide-iOS-Master/
    4. Terminal: pod install
    5. Open "Slide for Reddit.xcworkspace" through finder

### What needs to be done
Slide is still in Pre-alpha, and a lot of work has yet to be done. I will be going through and adding more documentation soon (issue #4), and will be taking care of the Settings screens myself. Any issues are fair game, but any issue with the "Help Wanted" tag is an issue that I have not started on or that would be straightforward to implement with a single PR. If you have any questions or want to be pointed in the right direction, feel free to send me a PM on Reddit to /u/ccrama, or join us on our IRC channel (top banner)!

### Issues

In any project, it's likely that a few bugs will slip through the cracks, so it
helps greatly if people document any bugs they find to ensure that they get
fixed promptly.

You can view a list of known issues and feature requests using [the issue tracker](
https://github.com/ccrama/Slide-ios/issues). If you don't see your issue (or you
aren't sure) feel free to [submit it!](https://github.com/ccrama/Slide-ios/issues/new)

Where appropriate, a screenshot works wonders to help us see exactly what the
issue is. You can upload screenshots directly using the GitHub issue tracker or
by attaching a link (to Imgur, for example), whichever is easier for you.

### Code

If you are a developer and wish to contribute to the app please fork the project
and submit a pull request.

If you have any questions, feel free to
[ask in the IRC channel](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/#slide) or
[drop me a message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=ccrama) on Reddit.
